The logic used in the programs is as follows:

Program 1: In program 1 labelled as "py1" i created a dictionary as per the question. I used the variable "choice" in order to let the user enter their search name and marks. I also made the input case sensitive so that the program doesn't give an error if the user doesn't enters "John" rather inputs "john". 

Program 2: In program 2 labelled as "py3" I created a list as peter the question containing numbers from 1 to 10.i used 2 loops that extracts the first five elements and then appends it to a new list, and a second list that contains the reversed elements from the list containing first five numbers.
